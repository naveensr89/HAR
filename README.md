Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

“The dataset contains data from experiments carried out with a group of 30
volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The
experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained
dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers
was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."
